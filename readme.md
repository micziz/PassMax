# General info

## What is PassMax?

PassMax is a **Secure** and **Local** password manager. It's built using python, and designed to be fast.

## Why should I use PassMax, and not something like 1Password?

PassMax is completely local. This means that unless a hacker has access to you computer (or you give away your pass.txt) your passwords are secure. (There also encrypted!) While with some effort you can run it on a database, the stock experience does not include it. 

# Installation

You are on the Lite branch of PassMax. This may (and will) be outdated. Ths is really for extreme case. Install instructions in the wiki but remove the requirements.txt step!
