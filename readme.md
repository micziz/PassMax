# General info 📖

## What is PassMax? ❓

PassMax is a **Secure** and **Local** password manager. It's built using python, and designed to be fast.

## Why should I use PassMax, and not something like 1Password? 🙋

PassMax is completely local. This means that unless a hacker has access to you computer (or you give away your pass.txt) your passwords are secure. (There also encrypted!) While with some effort you can run it on a database, the stock experience does not include it. 

# Installation 💿

Currently, PassMax can only be installed from source. It's not hard! You can find install instructions in the wiki.
